      <description>Medicaid dataset I am using the Medicaid Utilization dataset from https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/datasets.html. The data were collected from a 1986 consumer survey and had 996 respondents (observations). There are a total of 14 variables. &#39;visits&#39; gives the number of doctor visits. &#39;exposure&#39; gives the length of the abulatory care observation period in days. &#39;age&#39; gives the age of the respondent in years. &#39;income&#39; gives the annual household income. &#39;health1&#39; and &#39;health2&#39; are the first and second principal components/1000 of the three health variables:functional limitations, acute conditions, and chronic conditions.</description>

      <description>Dylan Pfannenstiel, dmp2636 Intro and Importing I selected data on reported antibiotic resistance in clinical Salmonella isolates. This data were collected in the year 2015. There are 3 separate datasets each with data on a different antibiotic. All include year, genus, specimen ID, genus, species, and serotype (serotype is a way to distinguish within the same species based on surface antigens). The first dataset gives data for ciproflaxin (CIP) resistance.</description>
